# Mezidia public roadmap

In this repository, you can find the [official Mezidia public product roadmap](https://github.com/mezidia/roadmap/projects/1). Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Join the discussion over on the [Mezidia Roadmap main discussion page](https://github.com/mezidia/roadmap/discussions/1). 

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue or a not, with a label that indicates each of the following:

- A **language** that shows repository main language. 

- A **feature area** that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs.

## Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the stage in which it is expected to ship next.

## Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

- **mobile:** Mobile applications (Android, IOS)
- **desktop:** Mobile applications (Windows, Linux, MacOS)
- **web:** Web applications (Sites, SPA, Internet portals, etc)
- **bot:** Bots on different platforms (Telegram, Discord, GitHub)
- **other:** Any other platforms not included in the previous ones
